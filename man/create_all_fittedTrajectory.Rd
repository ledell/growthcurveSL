\usage{
create_all_fittedTrajectory(subj_dat, grid_fits_dat, holdout_fits_dat = NULL,
  ID_var, t_var, y_var, sex_var, method, xy_pair_name = c("agedays", "htcm"),
  grid_fits_var = "preds", holdout_fits_var = "preds", checkpoints = c(50,
  100), fun_y_to_raw = hbgd::who_zscore2htcm, fun_y_to_z = function(x, y,
  ...) return(y))
}
\arguments{
\item{subj_dat}{Subject specific data to be added to the final object. This must also contain the observed outcome on each subect under
the column name specified by the \code{y_var} argument.
Note that this data doesn't contain any modeling fits.}

\item{grid_fits_dat}{The dataset containing the predictions for equally spaced time intervals,
along with the predictions for all data points in the training data (observed data).
The two types of predictions must be distinguished with the column indicator named \code{"train_point"}.
The training data fits are then selected based on all rows that satisfy \code{train_point==TRUE} in \code{grid_fits_dat}.}

\item{holdout_fits_dat}{Optional dataset containing the model predictions for holdout data-points (or equivalently out-of-sample predictions in cross-validation).}

\item{ID_var}{A character name of the column in \code{subj_dat}, \code{grid_fits_dat} and \code{holdout_fits_dat}  containing the unique subject identifiers.}

\item{t_var}{A character name of the column in \code{subj_dat}, \code{grid_fits_dat} and \code{holdout_fits_dat} with integer-valued time measurements (e.g., days, weeks, months).}

\item{y_var}{A character name of the column that represent the response variable in the model (the outcome).}

\item{sex_var}{A character name of the column that represent the response variable in the model (the outcome).}

\item{method}{A name of the modeling approach for future model comparison.}

\item{xy_pair_name}{... Same as in hbgd package...}

\item{grid_fits_var}{The column name in \code{grid_fits_dat} that contains the modeling predictions for each subject-time row.}

\item{holdout_fits_var}{The column name in \code{holdout_fits_dat} that contains the modeling predictions for each holdout subject-time row.}

\item{fun_y_to_raw}{The function to convert the scale of the observed outcome and predictions into the raw scale (height / weight).
If the fits are already on the raw scale then specify this argument as \code{function(x, y, ...) return(y)}.}

\item{fun_y_to_z}{The function to convert the scale of the observed outcome and predictions into the z-scale.
If the fits are already on the z-scale then specify this argument as \code{function(x, y, ...) return(y)}.}

\description{
Creates objects of class \code{fittedTrajectory} with growth curve predictions, one object for subject ID in the data.
This can be used for further growth curve analysis with hbgd R package.
Requires the the dataset containing the predicted growth curves for all subjects \code{grid_fits_dat}.
