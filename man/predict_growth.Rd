\usage{
predict_growth(modelfit, newdata, add_subject_data = FALSE, grid = FALSE,
  subset_idx = NULL, holdout = FALSE, stack = TRUE,
  verbose = getOption("growthcurveSL.verbose"))
}
\arguments{
\item{modelfit}{Model fit object returned by \code{\link{fit_growth}}.}

\item{newdata}{Subject-specific data for which predictions should be obtained.
If missing then the predictions for the training data will be typically returned.
See \code{holdout} for discussion of alternative cases.}

\item{add_subject_data}{Set to \code{TRUE} to add the subject-level data to
the resulting predictions (returned as a data.table).
When \code{FALSE} (default) only the actual predictions are returned (as a
matrix with each column representing predictions from a specific model).}

\item{grid}{Optional flag, set to \code{TRUE} when making growth
curve predictions for an entire grid ofÂ equally spaced time-points.}

\item{subset_idx}{A vector of row indices in \code{newdata} for which the
predictions should be obtain.
Default is \code{NULL} in which case all observations in \code{newdata} will
be used for prediction.}

\item{holdout}{Set to \code{TRUE} for out-of-sample predictions for validation
folds (out-of-sample observations) or holdouts.
 When \code{newdata} is missing there are two possible types of holdout predictions,
depending on the modeling approach.
 1. For \code{method = "holdout"} the default holdout predictions will be
based on validation data.
 2. For \code{method = "cv"} the default is to leave use the previous out-of-sample
(holdout) predictions from the training data.}

\item{stack}{Stack the predictions from individual models into a single vector of Super Learner predictions (default).
If set to \code{FALSE} the usual by model (by library) predictions are returned for every successful model fit in the library.}

\item{verbose}{Set to \code{TRUE} to print messages on status and information to
the console.}
}
\value{
A data.table of subject level predictions (subject are rows, columns
are different models)
or a data.table with subject level covariates added along with model-based predictions.
