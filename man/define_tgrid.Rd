\title{Define data with grids of time-points for growth curve prediction}
\usage{
define_tgrid(dataDT, ID, t_name, y, tgrid, grid_size = 150)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataDT}{Input data with all the relevant summaries that were used for modeling being already defined.}

\item{ID}{A character string name of the column that contains the unique subject identifiers.}

\item{t_name}{A character string name of the column with integer-valued measurement time-points (in days, weeks, months, etc).}

\item{y}{A character string name of the column that represent the response variable in the model.}

\item{tgrid}{Specify the grid of time-points directly.
If missing a subject-specific grid is defined based on the subject's follow-up range.}

\item{grid_size}{How many time-points should be used in equally spaced grid?
This argument is only used when \code{tgrid} is missing.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} of subject IDs and time-points, along with all the relevant subject specific curve summaries and predictors.
In addition, the output dataset also contains an indicator column 'train_point', set to \code{TRUE} for all (ID,time-points) that also appear
in the input data \code{dataDT}. That is 'train_point' indicates if the row might have been previously used for model training.
